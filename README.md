Yulu Bikes needs to be moved between the zones from low demand to zones of high demand. How do we plan our truck movements? A day can be broken into multiple time slots.
➢ The trucks should start focusing on the Whitefield first where there is high demand and it is to be checked properly
wether the bikes are in proper condition , check with the battery percentages and other important services to be taken
care .
➢ Next the truck has to move to Outer ring road which is 10.2 km from white field and necessary conditioning actions to be
done
➢ While covering these two zones another truck has to be complete its servicing in Electronic city
➢ After Covering ORR the truck has to go to Indira Nagar followed by kormangala , Jayanagar , CBD and finally Bhartiya
city
➢ All these movements of truck and servicing part should be done anytime before 5 am , between 10am-4pm and After 8
pm so that it wont clash the users and the field mans during the day
➢ Mondays , Tuesdays , wednesdays and sundays are the days the maximum usage of bikes so these days there should be
no shortage of bikes and low battery issues and other servicing problems for the users.
